## What Is Cloud Computing

The US National Institute of Standards and Technology created a definition It has 5 equally important traits:

computing resources on-demand and self-service. All you have to do is use a simple interface and you get the processing power, storage, and network you need, with no need for human intervention.
access these resources over the net from anywhere you want. The provider of those resources has a big pool of them and allocates them to customers out of that pool. That allows the provider to get economies of scale by buying in bulk and pass the savings on to the customers. Customers don't have to know or care about the exact physical location of those resources.
The resources are elastic. If you need more resources you can get more, rapidly. If you need less, you can scale back.
The customers pay only for what they use or reserve as they go. If they stop using resources, they stop paying.

## Google Cloud

Google Cloud consists of a set of physical assets, such as computers and hard disk drives, and virtual resources, such as virtual machines (VMs), that are contained in [Google's data centers](https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/) around the globe
# Google Datacenters
Each data center location is in a region. Regions are available in Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. Each region is a collection of zones, which are isolated from each other within the region. Each zone is identified by a name that combines a letter identifier with the name of the region.

# Accessing resources through services
In cloud computing, what you might be used to thinking of as software and hardware products, become services. These services provide access to the underlying resources. The list of available Google Cloud services is long, and it keeps growing. When you develop your website or application on Google Cloud, you mix and match these services into combinations that provide the infrastructure you need, and then add your code to enable the scenarios you want to build.
IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS
Virtualized data centers brought you Infrastructure as a Service, IaaS, and Platform as a Service, PaaS offerings.

IaaS offerings provide raw compute storage, and networks organized in ways that are familiar to data centers.
PaaS offerings, on the other hand, bind application code you write to libraries that give access to the infrastructure your application needs. That way, you can just focus on your application logic.
In the IaaS model, you pay for what you allocate.

In the PaaS model, you pay for what you use.

Both sure beat the old way where you bought everything in advance based on lots of risky forecasting. As Cloud Computing has evolved, the momentum has shifted towards managed infrastructure and managed services. GCP offers many services in which you need not worry about any resource provisioning at all. We'll discuss many in this course. They're easy to build into your applications and you pay peruse.

What about SaaS? Of course, Google's popular applications like Google Search, Gmail, Google Docs, and Google Drive are Software as a Service applications in that they're consumed directly over the internet by end-users (e.g. GSuite).
